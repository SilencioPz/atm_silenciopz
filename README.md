<h1 style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center; font-family: serif;">A fictional ATM built in Java, using Swing</h1>

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: serif;">
A simple ATM project, made thanks to this website: <a href="https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/java-projects/atm-project-in-java-with-source-code//">ITSOURCECODE</a>.
<br>
I modified: 
<br>
1) A Login Screen, for Register and Validation of registered users. An alternative to bank cards;
<br>
2) A Balance class, that shows how much the user has in account;
<br>
3) A Deposit class, pretty clean and functional;
<br>
4) A Withdraw class, clean as Deposit;
<br>
5) A TransferTo class, an important implementation that wasn't present in the borrowed code.
<br>
All screens using JDialog, a modal to navigate easier in the project. I forgot to create a JUnit for this one, but in the next I'll implement for sure.
<br>
I'll continue to improve my skills. Hope to bring more projects useful for a greater public! :)
